DishDash is a food delivery app built with the MERN stack. It uses bcryptjs for user authentication and various frontend frameworks like Bootstrap and Material UI. The app has a carousel that updates in real time and a search feature that allows users to find dishes by name.

The use of bcryptjs for user authentication ensures that user data is secure, and the use of Bootstrap and Material UI makes the app look and feel great. The carousel and search features make it easy for users to find the dishes they are looking for, and the real-time updates ensure that the app is always up-to-date.
